	# If you don't normalize the direction, the player will move about 1.4 times faster in diagonals. That is due to the fact that a vector of length 1 on the X axis and 1 on the Y axis has a diagonal of length sqrt(1^2 + 1^2)

	# The steering vector is too long by default, so we normalize it to get better control over it. That's partly because in this script, we're dealing with motion directly, not using velocity as an intermediate step.

	# And that's where we set the car sprite's angle, in Radians. The arc tangent of a vector's coordinates gives you its angle. With the steering setup, we can use that angle on the sprite and it works well for free! There are some limitations when you go to opposite directions, but that is linked to the car's motion rather than these 2 lines setting the angle.
	# Note we only change the angle when there's motion, otherwise the car's angle is reset to 0 when it stops.
